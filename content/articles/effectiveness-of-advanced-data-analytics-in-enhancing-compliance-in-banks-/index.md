### Factors in banking that derail AI effectiveness

#### Inconsistence in information output

Inconsistencies in information output lead to weak databases that cannot be leveraged for problem-solving or making new strategies. The existing data tend to offer minimal insights on existing risks, compliance status, and present market gaps.

The inconsistency leads to delayed processes that cost time and money. It wastes a lot of storage because the same data is kept in different places. The interpretation of such data deems redundant, and most financial institutions refer to it as dirty data.

The decentralized approach of storing data confuses different departments or subsidiaries. Each department figures out its data and interprets it uniquely. This aspect causes inconsistency in business conduct. The data quality fails to match the business operations needs creating a soft spot for non-compliance.

#### Lack of alignment between compliance systems and the existing data

Banks lack the alignment between the compliance systems and the current large data that tend to be diverse.
